We at hashmail are psyched to announce the public launch of the hashmail console for decentralized applications.

hashmail is the **easiest way for dapps to reach their web3 users across channels**. 

Basically, we're like twilio, natively built for a decentralized world

## why do dapps need a communication solution?

Most dapps in web3 suffer from three acute problems - **high churn, poor engagement, low repeat rates**. 

The root cause is communication - or _rather the lack of it_. 

Your customers in web3 need and **expect richer, more personalized communications** (transaction updates, statements, reminders), across **multiple channels of their choice** (not just on your discord or telegram)

web3 dev teams deeply understand this issue, but have often **struggled to prioritize setting up a communications infrastructure**. Understandly so, due to the enormous complexity in setting up a secure, scalable, and easy-to-use communications infrastructure

hashmail simply abstracts all this away for you.

## We obsess over security and compliance, so you don't have to

- All messages and user preferences are stored with deep encryption to ensure complete privacy and security of comms.

- Message content is stored privately in IPFS in the standard EML format for permissionless access.

- Advanced anti-spam filters for safe and secure communication experiences for users. As an added layer of security, we do a manual verification and onboarding of dapps to ensure a safe experience for users.

Finally, we are **fully compliant with GDPR, and all other similar regulations on user communication, so that you can focus on building your dapp**!

## In our closed beta, we partnered with leading dapps across multiple chains, who saw massive lifts in CSAT, retention and repeat rates

We support 20+ dapps across all EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Binance, Arbitrum, Optimism, OKC, Bitgert), as well as Solana. We will soon be expanding to NEAR, Aptos, Sui, and more
