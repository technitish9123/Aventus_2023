**We have exciting news!**

hashmail is extremely proud and privileged to announce a partnership with Unstoppable Domains - the leading decentralized identity and domain name provider for the web3 ecosystem

With this partnership, users on hashmail can now send and receive emails using your unstoppable domain linked to your wallet address. Instead of typing out long wallet addresses, just send emails directly to your friend’s .nft, .crypto or any of the 6 other domains provided by UD

Additionally, you can also receive emails directly to your unstoppable domains at _\<unstoppable-domain\>@hashmail.dev_. The next time an app asks you for an email, simply use the UD domain connected to hashmail to receive all emails in a private, trusted and secure mailbox

We have also integrated ‘Login with Unstoppable’ to provide you a frictionless method of authentication. Simply click on ‘login with unstoppable domains’, enter your UD domain, and verify ownership to login to hashmail

Swapnika, Co-Founder and CEO at hashmail, said - “there is a big user experience problem in the crypto ecosystem today. Wallet addresses are complicated 40+ character strings, it’s difficult to share them, and there is no way to communicate with them. With Unstoppable Domains, you can resolve these wallet addresses to a simple memorable domain. And hashmail provides you with an inbox for your domain, so that you can send and receive emails simply with this domain”

Nilkanth Iyer, Head of Asia Pacific at Unstoppable Domains said, “We’re thrilled to partner with hashmail and to make it easier for people to log in seamlessly, and get a mailbox for their domain. With web3 domains, people own their identity data. Now, they can use their domain to exchange emails using the hashmail inbox in a web3 native way, with no need to share their web2 email again.”
